Hello, World!

Hi there, I'm Ethan. I have learnt a lot of php, some mysql, basic java, very basic js and a useful amount of python.
Still in high school, intend to learn computer science, woo, and have made many-a-script whether that be a scoreboard on python that automatically updates on a webpage or some batch scripts to make a computer stop working.

Hoping to learn more, github seems like a good place to start.
